( 2 ) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work cooperatively with other Federal and State agencies , as well as nonprofit organizations , to create appropriate advisories for the distribution to the public of explanations of the potential adverse effects of mercury exposure from fish consumption ; ( 3 ) require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to work cooperatively with State fish and game officials to create an informative guide for distribution to the public about the dangers of the consumption of recreationally - caught fish ; ( 4 ) require the Food and Drug Administration to resume its seafood methyl - mercury monitoring program to better document mercury levels in various fish species sold in commerce ; ( 5 ) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services , in cooperation with private and public organizations , to design and implement a National Public Education Program regarding the presence of methyl - mercury in seafood and fish consumption advisories for methyl - mercury ;

( 2 ) among the first and most critical of those impacts will be change to patterns of precipitation around the world , which will affect water availability for the most basic drinking water and domestic water needs of populations in many areas of the United States ; ( 3 ) drinking water utilities throughout the United States , as well as those in Europe , Australia , and Asia , are concerned that extended changes in precipitation will lead to extended droughts ; ( 4 ) supplying water is highly energy - intensive and will become more so as climate change forces more utilities to turn to alternative supplies ; ( 5 ) energy production consumes a significant percentage of the fresh water resources of the United States ; ( 6 ) since 2003 , the drinking water industry of the United States has sponsored , through a nonprofit water research foundation , various studies to assess the impacts of climate change on drinking water supplies ; ( 7 ) those studies demonstrate the need for a comprehensive program of research into the full range of impacts on drinking water utilities , including impacts on water supplies , facilities , and customers ; ( 8 ) that nonprofit water research foundation is also coordinating internationally with other drinking water utilities on shared research projects and has hosted international workshops with counterpart European and Asian water research organizations to develop a unified research agenda for applied research on adaptive strategies to address climate change impacts ;

is to establish a commission to study and report back to Congress recommendations on simplifying , reforming , or replacing the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 .\tSEC. 3 .\tFINDINGS .\tThe Congress finds the following : ( 1 ) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is overly complex , imposes significant burdens on individuals , businesses , and the economy , is extremely difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to administer , and is in need of fundamental reform and simplification .\t( 2 ) Many of the problems encountered by taxpayers in dealing with the Internal Revenue Service -- especially those arising from misunderstandings of the Code -- could be eliminated or alleviated by fundamental reform and simplification .\t( 3 ) The Internal Revenue Service faces continual difficulty in administering an overly lengthy , complex , and confusing tax code .\t( 4 ) Taxpayers and tax experts have repeatedly called for a simplification of the current tax code .\t( 5 ) The complexity of the current code places a significant burden on individual filers , including extensive record keeping , time requirements to prepare returns , gaining an understanding of the exemptions for which they may qualify , and other burdens .\tThis has forced the majority of taxpayers to turn to tax professionals to prepare their tax returns .\t( 6 ) Congress is continually modifying and correcting the Code , leading to annual uncertainty and only adding to the patchwork of complexity and confusion .\t( 7 ) The Federal Government 's present fiscal outlook for continuing and sustained budget surpluses provides a unique opportunity for the Congress to consider measures for fundamental reform and simplification of the tax laws .\t( 8 ) Recent efforts to simplify or reform the tax laws have not been successful due in part to the difficulty of developing broad - based , nonpartisan support for proposals to make such changes .\tSEC. 4 .\tESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON

Appointments to the Commission shall be made not later than 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act .\tSEC. 5 .\tRULES OF THE COMMISSION .\t( a ) Quorum .\t-- Nine members of the

{"document": "SECTION 1 .\tSHORT TITLE .\tThis Act may be cited as the `` Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research , Cure , and Care Act of 2011 '' .\tSEC. 2 .\tFINDINGS .\tCongress finds the following : ( 1 ) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are autoimmune , chronic , inflammatory , painful , and disabling diseases that require lifelong timely and appropriate medical intervention and care and have no cure .\t( 2 ) Current studies indicate that the prevalence of psoriasis in the United States ranges between two and three percent , affecting approximately 7.5 million men , women , and children of all ages , approximately 17,000 individuals in each congressional district , and has an adverse impact on the quality of life for virtually all affected .\t( 3 ) Psoriasis often is overlooked or dismissed because it is not typically a direct cause of death .\tPsoriasis is commonly and incorrectly considered by insurers , employers , policymakers , and the public as a mere annoyance -- a superficial problem , mistakenly thought to be contagious , due to poor hygiene , or both .\tAs such , treatment for psoriasis is often incorrectly categorized as `` cosmetic '' and not `` medically necessary '' .\t( 4 ) Psoriasis is connected with an elevated risk for other serious , chronic , and life - threatening comorbid conditions , including cardiovascular disease , diabetes , stroke , and cancer .\tA higher prevalence of stroke , atherosclerosis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , Crohn 's disease , lymphoma , metabolic syndrome , and liver disease are also found in people with psoriasis as compared to the general population .\tUp to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop potentially disabling psoriatic arthritis .\t( 5 ) The National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) funded a study that found that psoriasis may cause as much physical and mental disability as other major chronic diseases , including cancer , arthritis , hypertension , heart disease , diabetes , and depression .\t( 6 ) Psoriasis is associated with elevated rates of depression , anxiety , and suicidality ( suicidal thoughts , suicide attempts , and completed suicides ) .\tIndividuals with psoriasis are twice as likely to have thoughts of suicide as people without psoriasis or with other chronic conditions .\t( 7 ) The risk of premature death is 50 percent higher for people with severe psoriasis .\tThis translates to people with severe psoriasis dying four years earlier , on average , than people without psoriasis .\t( 8 ) The economic consequences of psoriasis , both for individuals and the health care system , are significant .\tTotal direct and indirect health care costs of psoriasis are calculated at $ 11,250,000,000 with work loss accounting for 40 percent of the cost burden .\tPeople with psoriasis have significantly higher health care resource utilization and costs than the general population .\tAdditionally , psoriasis patients with comorbidities are more likely to experience urgent care , have greater rates of hospitalization , more frequent outpatient visits , and incur greater costs than psoriasis patients without comorbidities .\t( 9 ) Early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis may help prevent irreversible joint damage .\t( 10 ) Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presents a challenge for patients and their health care providers .\tA wide range of treatment options is available ; however , adverse side effects and success varies from patient to patient .\tThe same treatments do not work for every patient and a treatment that may have been effective for a period of time can stop working .\t( 11 ) Despite a number of recent breakthroughs that have led to some new treatments , too many people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis still can not live normal lives .\tFor many of these individuals , existing treatments are not effective or appropriate or may not be accessible due to cost and insurance barriers .\t( 12 ) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis constitute a significant national health issue that deserves a comprehensive and coordinated response by States and the Federal Government with involvement of the health care provider , patient , and public health communities .\tSEC. 3 .\tNATIONAL PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS DATA COLLECTION .\t( a ) In General .\t-- The Secretary of Health and Human Services , acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , is authorized to undertake psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis data collection efforts , including incorporating questions into public health surveys , questionnaires , and other databases in existence as of the date of the enactment of this Act to collect information , with respect to psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis , regarding -- ( 1 ) the prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the United States ;

( 3 ) the National Institutes of Health is encouraged to continue to work with the organizations and private sector stakeholders who convene the multidisciplinary scientific meeting to discuss future directions of psoriasis and comorbid research ;
